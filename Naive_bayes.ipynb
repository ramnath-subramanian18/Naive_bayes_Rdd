spending a fortune on gym memberships protein supplements or designer trainers and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry i pick up a fitness

first book that bronson has written from behind bars having already published birdman opens his mind which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majesty s pleasure jimmy boyle the scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prison s

while in jail he recently signed a three book deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported NUMBER million and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak so why is it that men like collins bronson and boyle who can be so destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck on the inside steve richards bronson s publisher has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound he says prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education if their early years have been hard it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents however richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that he says once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine the very essence of who they are they ask themselves am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence or am i a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something

URL internet can level the political playing field by mike mccurry and larry purpuro not many months from now people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of american democracy at shopping malls on factory floors at church socials and even on our front stoops we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office while chances are high that we won t know them personally they will walk up to us offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes just as technology is affecting every other area of communication it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters in this year s gop gubernatorial primary california secretary of state bill jones who faced better funded candidates acquired the e mail addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent each an unsolicited e mail asking for support that day he might have chosen any of the more traditional and more expensive methods of contacting voters such as direct mail radio spots or tv ads but he spent only about NUMBER cents per message instead of NUMBER cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium had jones chosen direct mail radio or tv that communication would have been equally unsolicited as defined in the e mail world few voters would have opted in to receive campaign information from jones through any of those channels the response to jones e mail effort however was swift and intense he was lambasted by anti spam advocates and media coverage was almost entirely negative to be fair some of jones tactics could have been refined he used a less than perfect list and no standard practice paid for disclaimer in the message his detractors however attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e mail was sent unsolicited in fact jones online campaign may have been his most visible asset in an era of cynicism toward money in politics money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums jones tried to level the playing field no one likes commercial spam it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive but as a sophisticated society it s time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e mail sent by political candidates to voters the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam we believe e mail is no more intrusive than direct mail telemarketing or tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters a simple link in good e mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest he or she can use the internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes with more than NUMBER percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e mail accounts it makes sense that political candidates use this medium candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups but the broader point remains when a political candidate sends a voter an e mail that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it unsubscribe from the list read it or even reply and engage the sender that choice should belong to the voter not to anti spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e mail political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can and let voters decide what to do with that information mike mccurry former press secretary for president clinton is ceo of an advocacy management and communications software company

database password then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree you can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere so that at least an attacker has to get two different

these database keys as noted above and make the web program contact it create a very limited protocol that only lets you do the operations you need you can add specific operations later there s a performance hit which you re trading for improved data isolation giorgio zoppi wrote on fri aug NUMBER NUMBER david wheeler wrote the standard way to store passwords is not to store passwords instead store a salted hash of the password in a database when you get a purported password you re salt it compute the hash and determine if they are the same this is how unix has done it for years you want

cnet com special to zdnet news august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm pt url URL URL in a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially the same as bumper stickers the federal election commission has declared that senders of text based political ads don t have to disclose who funded them in an advisory opinion issued thursday the fec also suggested such messages include either a phone number or web site link so people could easily learn who paid for the message however the additional information won t be required the opinion could encourage the adoption of text based political ads as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters at the same time opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam target wireless a small new

NUMBER character maximum political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement target wireless petition was supported by the national republican

not to meddle with new technology that has the potential to reach more voters we have tried very hard not to get in the way particularly before everyone understands how the technology is going to work he said opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political messages while remaining anonymous biersack said the fec can revisit the issue if those problems surface target wireless president craig krueger characterized the opinion as good for america it will allow people to receive more communication from

you get samizdat spam the worst that can be said is that you might have read it and as long as the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn t opt in like party officials then other recipients can
